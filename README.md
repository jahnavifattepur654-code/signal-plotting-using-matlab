# signal-plotting-using-matlab
I have plotted 4 types of signals such as sine, square, triangular and composite signal by using MATLAB GUI sine signal.
sine signal: sine function from MATLAB
square signal: square function from MATLAB
triangular signal: sawtooth function
composite signal: addition of signals
I have written specific code for each signal in editior window.
I plotted these 4 signals on GUI window.
I have used EXIT button to exit from the GUI window.
I have used MATLAB 2016a version to get the results.
